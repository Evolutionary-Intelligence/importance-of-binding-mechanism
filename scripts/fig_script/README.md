# Organisation of the scripts

## Main figures
[background.py](./background.py) - Plots figure that introduces the SD model and the trapping mechanism.
[description_fig.py](./description_fig.py) - Plot the description of the fitting procedure of the CS model to the SD model.
[AP_compare_drug.py](./AP_compare_drug.py) - Plot the comparison of the IKr, AP and APD90 between the SD model and the CS model.
[AP_transient.py](./AP_transient.py) - Compares the IKr and AP of the ORd-SD model and the ORd-CS model at the first few pulses after addition of drugs.
[protocol.py](./protocol.py) - Plots the protocols used in the study, the Hill curves of drugs when stimulated with these protocols and the APD90 of the ORd-CS model when the ionic conductance is scaled with the Hill curves.
[SA_3D.py](./SA_3D.py) - Plot the signed RMSD of the explored parameter space and the region where the RMSD between the APD90 of the ORd-SD model and the ORd-CS model is small.

## Supplementary figures
[supp_drugs_comparison.py](./supp_drugs_comparison.py) - Plot the APD90 of the drug simulated by the ORd-SD model and the ORd-CS model, and the Hill curves of the drug generated by different protocols.
[supp_N_difference.py](./supp_N_difference.py) - Plot the range of RMSD for the synthetic drugs when varying the Hill coefficient.
[supp_APD_Vhalf.py](./supp_APD_Vhalf.py) - Compare the AP and the APD90 of different Vhalf-trap values.
