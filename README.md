# binding-mechanism

In this work, we study the impact of including state-dependent drug binding in a mathematical ion channel model of the human Ether-Ã€-Go-Go-Related Gene (hERG) channel.
We compared the action potential predictions when modelling drug binding of hERG using a state-dependent model versus a conductance scaling model.
