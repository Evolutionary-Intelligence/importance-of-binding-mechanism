# Importance of modelling hERG binding

In this work, we study the impact of including state-dependent drug binding in a mathematical ion channel model of the human Ether-Ã€-Go-Go-Related Gene (hERG) channel.
We compared the action potential predictions when modelling drug binding of hERG using a state-dependent model versus a conductance scaling model.

## Code
All scripts that generate the data and plot the figures are in the [scripts](./scripts) folder.

## Reproduce figures, including intermediate files
Figures can be reproduced with the command:
```bash
make FigureX
```
where `X` is the figure number. The list of commands to reproduce the figures are provided below.

### List of commands to reproduce the figures
1. `Figure1` 
    - to reproduce Figure 1 (background figure)
2. `Figure2` 
    - to reproduce Figure 2 (method description figure)
    - requires data generated from the script [binding_kinetics_comparison.py](scripts/binding_kinetics_comparison.py) for example drug N (also run in command `Figure4`)
3. `Figure3`
    - to reproduce Figure 3 (model comparison for example drug T)
4. `Figure4`
    - to reproduce Figure 4 (model comparison for example drug N)
5. `Figure5`
    - to reproduce Figure 5 (AP comparison at transient phase)
6. `Figure6`
    - to reproduce Figure 6 (protocol dependence of AP prolongation)
7. `Figure7`
    - to reproduce Figure 7 and Figure S12 (parameter space exploration)
8. `FigureS1_S10`
    - to reproduce Figure S1 to S10 (APD90, qNet and Hill curves for several drugs)
9. `FigureS11`
    - to reproduce Figure S11 (RMSD distribution with varying parameter N)
10. `FigureS13_S14`
    - to reproduce Figure S13 and S14 (RMSD and APD90 at different Vhalf-trap values)
    - requires data generated from the script [SA_param_space.py](scripts/SA_param_space.py) (also run in command `Figure7`)

Some figures were modified for better visualisation, i.e. Figure 1 to Figure 4.
